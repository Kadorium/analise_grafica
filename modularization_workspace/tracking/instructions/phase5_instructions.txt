PHASE 5: UPDATE HTML

Follow these steps to update the HTML to use the new modular system:

1. Open frontend\index.html in a text editor

2. Find the script tag that loads app.js, which might look like:
   <script src="js/app.js"></script>

3. Replace it with:
   <script type="module" src="js/main.js"></script>

4. Save the file

This change tells the browser to load main.js as a JavaScript module,
which enables the import/export statements used in our modular system.

After completing these steps, run the module.bat file again to move to the next phase.
