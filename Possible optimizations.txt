Possible optimizations:
checking creating folder that exists. if error, just warn.
The current log_optimization_request is called multiple times. It should ideally be called once at the end with all information.
Pass all four debug log lists to log_optimization_request via its extra_info or by adding dedicated parameters.

optimization : Now I need to add the calculate_equity_curve function since we're referencing it: you have the same in backtesting, no?

we are trying to the a modularization strucuture of the file app.js here. teh modularization plan is attached@modularization-plan.md take a look into this project to see everything. i am manually testing the modularization.


The assets displayed in the table will now come from the actual multi-asset data that was uploaded, rather than hardcoded values like JPM and WMT. If no multi-asset data is available, it falls back to a shorter default list.




linha fixa em indicator_utils.py
 Args:
        data (pandas.DataFrame): DataFrame containing price and indicator data.
        plot_config (dict): Configuration for what to plot.
            Example: {
                'main_indicators': ['sma_20', 'ema_20', 'bb_upper', 'bb_lower'],
                'subplot_indicators': ['rsi', 'macd', 'volume'],
                'title': 'Custom Chart Title',
                'start_date': '2020-01-01',

        debug_save_path (str, optional): If provided, saves the plot to this path.
            
    Returns:
        str: Base64 encoded PNG image.






I'm working on modularizing a large HTML/Python project. I've attached the modularization plan at @modularization-plan.md. 

Current status:
1. Currently working on ADJUST HERE: optimization-section

Main file structure:
- app.py: Main backend entry point (FastAPI app) that orchestrates the workflow
- frontend/: Contains web UI with HTML, CSS, JS (modules in js/modules/, utilities in js/utils/)
- data/: For data files, uploads, and data processing scripts
- indicators/: Python modules for technical indicators and utilities
- strategies/: Python modules implementing trading strategies
- backtesting/: Contains the backtesting engine and related utilities
- optimization/: Contains code for strategy parameter optimization
- results/: Stores output files, configs, and optimization result

Here's what I need help with now:
ADJUST HERE 1 - when selecting a strategy in id="optimization-strategy", with a metric selected in id="optimization-metric", it says Please select at least one parameter to optimize and nothing happens.
2. Ensure the current implementation aligns with the overall modularization plan

Please analyze the code with these specific considerations:
1. Maintain consistency with already-modularized sections
2. Follow the architectural patterns established so far
3. Identify any potential dependency issues
